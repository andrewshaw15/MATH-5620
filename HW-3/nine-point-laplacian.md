# Laplacian Equation - 9 Point Stencil

**Function Name:** ninePointLaplacian

**Author:** Andrew Shaw

**Language:** C++14

**Purpose/Description:** This function finds the solution of the 2D Laplace equation *&Delta;u = sin(xy)* on the unit square with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions using LU Factorization by transforming the equation into *AU = F*. This function uses as helper functions initF() to initialize the right hand side (see [Initialize Nine Point Laplacian](https://andrewshaw15.github.io/MATH-5620/HW-3/initialize-nine-point-laplacian)) and a modified LUFactorization() to solve the linear system of equations (see [LU Factorization](https://andrewshaw15.github.io/MATH-5620/HW-2/LU-Factorization)).
